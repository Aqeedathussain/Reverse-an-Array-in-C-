# C++ Program: Reverse Array Traversal

This repository contains a beginner-friendly C++ program that takes 5 user inputs, stores them in an array, and then prints the array in **reverse order** using a backward loop.

---

##  Step-by-Step Explanation (Conceptual Overview)

### 1 **User Input into Array**
- The program declares a fixed-size array.
- A loop runs from index 0 to 4.
- Each loop iteration takes one value from the user and stores it in the array.
- This demonstrates:
  - Using loops for input collection  
  - Storing data sequentially in an array  

---

### 2 **Reverse Traversal Logic**
- After input is complete, a loop runs **backwards** from index 4 to 0.
- Each element is printed in reverse order, showing how arrays can be accessed from end to start.
- This teaches:
  - Reverse looping (`i--`)  
  - Output formatting  
  - Understanding array indexing from both directions  

---

## 3 Key Concepts Learned
- Declaring and using arrays  
- Taking user input using a loop  
- Accessing array elements in reverse  
- Basic control flow using `for` loops  

---

## Purpose
This small program helps beginners understand how to collect input and manipulate array data, especially reverse-order printing—an essential concept for many algorithms.
